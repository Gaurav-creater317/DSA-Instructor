# 📚 DSA Instructor – Ask Me Anything About DSA

This is a fun and interactive chatbot project where you can ask any question about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

👉 If your question is about DSA → It answers politely and explains.
👉 If your question is not related to DSA → It replies rudely (for fun 🤭).

# It’s like having a “DSA Mentor” with attitude 😅

⚙️ How It Works

Input → User types a question.

Check Topic → The bot checks if the question is related to DSA (keywords like array, linked list, stack, queue, tree, graph, sorting, searching, etc.).

Response:

If related to DSA → Give a proper explanation.

If not related to DSA → Respond rudely (but in a humorous way).
